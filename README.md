byte1: I used the cd and ls commands several times until i got the answer.
byte2: I used the command grep and I typed 'grep "will find" shakespeare.txt' so that I can get the answer.
byte3: I used the command  'diff "shakespeare.txt" "shakespeare.modified.txt"' so that i can observe the differences of the 2 files.
