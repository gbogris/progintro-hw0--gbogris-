byte1: I used the cd and ls commands several times until i got the answer.
byte2: I used the command grep and I typed 'grep "will find" shakespeare.txt' so that I can get the answer.
byte3: I used the command  'diff "shakespeare.txt" "shakespeare.modified.txt"' so that i can observe the differences of the 2 files.
byte4: I did not know how to use properly the find command(i used the man find command) so I searched for it!
byte5: I noticed that I could not gcc the file right away. For that reason, I entered the tmp directory, I made a new file there and then I used the cp command.Afterwards, the compilation was easily made.
byte6: I did the same trick that I did in byte5. I went to the tmp directory, I made a new file and moved all of byte6.zip's info to the new file. At the end, i just unziped the file and it worked.
byte7: I used again the same logic( moved to tmp) because it would not let me open byte7.txt. So after typing the command tar --usage( and the command man tar) I used the right options so that I can obtain the answer. 
byte8: Firstly, I used the command xxd and I noticed the cant_keep_secrets_from_you message and 3 dots(2 red ones and 1 blue). Afterwards, I used the pico command and I saw the answer and 3 characters before it. I do not think that the characters afect the result
byte9: I knew that I had to use nano, if I wanted to open the file. So I got the idea of using ~/- from the info that I got, when I used the command 'man nano'.
