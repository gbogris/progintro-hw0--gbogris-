byte0: you_just_mastered_changing_directories
	used the cd and ls command several times until i got what i wanted
byte1: by using the command 'man'
byte2: grep_and_you_will_find
	i used the command grep and i typed (grep "will find" shakespeare.txt) so that i can find the answer. 
byte3: old word: players new word: programmers 
	i used the command  (diff "shakespeare.txt" "shakespeare.modified.txt") so that i can see the differences of the 2 files.
byte4: the_triwizard_cup_is_now_yours
	i did not know how to use properly the find command(i used the man find command) so i searched for it!
byte5: sdi2500136_1760980685_-452811896_94_71_4_38_14907_22
	So i noticed that i could not gcc the file right away. For that reason, I entered the tmp directory i made a new file there and then i used the cp command.Afterwards, the compilation was easily made.
byte6: unzipping_is_a_piece_of_cake
	I did the same think that i did in byte5. I went to the tmp directory, I made a new file and moved all of byte6.zip's info to the new file. At the end, i just unziped the file and it worked.   
byte7: tar_jokes_cant_stick
	I used again the same logic( moved to tmp) because it would not let me open byte7.txt. So after using the command tar --usage i used the right parametrs so that i can obtain the answer.
byte8: cant_keep_secrets_from_you
	firstly, i used the command xxd and i noticed the cant_keep_secrets_from_you message and 3 dots. Afterwards, I used the pico command and I saw the answer and 3 characters before it. I do not think that the characters afect the result.	
byte 9: filepaths_are_handy 
	I knew that i had to use nano, if I wanted to open the file. So i got the idea of using ~/- from the info that I got, when i used the command 'man nano'.
