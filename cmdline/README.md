byte1: I used the cd and ls commands several times until i got the answer.
byte2: I used the command grep and I typed 'grep "will find" shakespeare.txt' so that I can get the answer.
byte3: I used the command  'diff "shakespeare.txt" "shakespeare.modified.txt"' so that i can observe the differences of the 2 files.
byte4: I did not know how to use properly the find command(i used the man find command) so I searched for it!
byte5: I noticed that I could not gcc the file right away. For that reason, I entered the tmp directory, I made a new file there and then I used the cp command.Afterwards, the compilation was easily made.
byte6: I did the same trick that I did in byte5. I went to the tmp directory, I made a new file and moved all of byte6.zip's info to the new file. At the end, i just unziped the file and it worked.
byte7: I used again the same logic( moved to tmp) because it would not let me open byte7.txt. So after typing the command tar --usage( and the command man tar) I used the right options so that I can obtain the answer. 
byte8: Firstly, I used the command xxd and I noticed the cant_keep_secrets_from_you message and 3 dots(2 red ones and 1 blue). Afterwards, I used the pico command and I saw the answer and 3 characters before it. I do not think that the characters afect the result
byte9: I knew that I had to use nano, if I wanted to open the file. So I got the idea of using ~/- from the info that I got, when I used the command 'man nano'.
byte10: I used the command 'sort -d names.txt | head'( The correct option(-d) was found when I viewed the 'man sort' command) so that I can find answers. But this command only allowed me to view the first 10 names. So i used man head and i found the -n option. Afterwards, I made some changes and finally i got my answer.
byte11: Firstly, I used the commands 'man sort' and 'man uniq' to find out the answer. After many failed attemps,( I tried to find the right combo between uniq -c and sort) I came up with the solution.
byte12: I did not follow the instructions in this one. I just used ls -alh and found out that there is a hidden directory named .cache. After finding it, tuxsay was easily found.
byte13: Firstly, I ued cd to move to the repo directory and then I used the git log README.md command to extract the answers.
byte14: No he is not right at all. If someone used the command git log -p he could read all the information that is now removed(his novella included). The removed text is red coloured and the information that is green coloured, is all the info that the user added to the file.
